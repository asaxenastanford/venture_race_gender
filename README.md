# venture_race_gender
The VC Initiative has a database of 32,044 early stage investors. This database stores the first name, last name, email, and LinkedIn profile (in relevant cases) of the investors. However, they lack information about the gender and race of individual investors. As such, the goal of this work is to predict with a high degree of accuracy the gender and race of each investor in the database. There are existing web scrapping APIs, such as Genderize and Name Prism, that keep active records of names and their commonly associated genders and ethnicities. However, these APIs have had limited ability to accurately calculate the associated values for uncommon names, which results in unreliable results. As such, these APIs are used as a baseline in this analysis, and I built upon them by scrapping google search results for images of names that yielded low confidence results. These images were passed into existing image classification neural networks in the Face Plus Plus API. In addition, I leveraged Googleâ€™s Bert pre-trained language representations to use a shallow RNN classifier to estimate race and gender for names with low confidence results.
